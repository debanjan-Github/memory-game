# memory-game
Its a memory game based on your short time rememberence of few circle positions.
On the page initially 5 circles will appear.
on click over any circle all circles will disappear.
if you click the next box with the circle positions you saw before disappearing you will win, 
and on screen you will see more number of circles again the same way to play as stated above.
Every time you win number of circles will increase.
If you loose that is click on a box where ther was no circle, again 5 circles will come to start the game.

There is also a reset button you can reset anytime.

Thank You.
